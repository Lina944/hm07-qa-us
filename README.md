# Sprint 7 project

For Project 7 I did write tests for GET, POST, PUT & DELETE requests and ran test for both the response code and body of each request.
A README file is added to the project for qualification of what is included.

For this project I used Postman, VisualStudioCode and GitHub to create and run the tests as well Swagger to verify the response code.
Step by step running the tests:
Open the template in hm07-qa-us folder as per requirement in the VS code application. Start the code with GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. At at least 2 tests ( 1 for response code and 1 for response body)
Paste the API URL server in config.js.
Be sure the tests are saved and then use npx jest tp run the tests using the VS Code terminal
